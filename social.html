                           <p><strong>Family: </strong>I am the oldest child in my family. 
                              Other than myself, there is also my sister Nancy, who is ten years younger than me.
                              I took care of her when she was growing up and love to spend time and joke around with her.
                              My father is in academia and is currently a Director for the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry.
                           </p>
                           <p><strong>Early Childhood: </strong>I was born on February 5, 1992 in China near the city of Shanghai. 
                              I lived in China with my grandparents for 5 years in a rural village. 
                              The village focused mostly on farming and fishing (because it was near a river).
                              In comparison to large cities, I find that where I spent my early childhood was way more
                              beautiful and had a lot of nature.
                           </p>
                           <p><strong>To Germany: </strong> I moved to Germany in 1998 because my father was working there in the Chemistry field.
                              I lived in Hannover for one year and Berlin the next year, 
                              and I attended 1st and 2nd grade in Germany. I learned to speak, read, and write German after 2 months.
                              I love how clean Europe was in terms of street rodents and pests, but many people smoked.
                           </p>
                           <p><strong>Landing in the US: </strong>I moved to Boston in 2000 when my father worked at Tufts University as a researcher
                              and I have lived here since then.
                              I picked up English in 3 months and attended Lucy Stone Elementary in Dorchester.
                              I was one of the only Asian kids at my school (literally), but my classmates liked me and became
                              my friends after a few weeks.
                           </p>
                           <p><strong>Boston Latin School (High School): </strong>I took the ISEE test and got into Boston Latin School
                              and attended from 7th till 12th grade. Boston Latin School is the oldest school in the United States (est. in 1635).
                              Many famous people in history and politics attended Boston Latin School before me so it is a well-known school,
                              especially in Boston. I really enjoyed my time there and many of the friendships I formed at BLS are still
                              continuing and I got to know many of my closest friends at that school.
                           </p>
                           <p><strong>University: </strong>I got accepted into Tufts University in senior year of high school.
                              I really liked Tufts out of the other colleges I had visited because it seemed to be a really good
                              environment for me and people were very friendly. I meet a lot of great friends at Tufts as well and 
                              the years went by very fast. I majored in Computer Science, as a Bachelor of Science, because it
                              was something that I was always interested in.

                           <p><strong>Nature: </strong>I find it peaceful to walk in nature and explore new places like public gardens and parks.</p>
                           <p><strong>Food: </strong>I love trying new food and restaurants with my friends. 
                              If you feel the same way and have good places to recommend we will surely become friends.</p>
                           <p><strong>Art: </strong>I love going to museums and enjoying works of history. Visited the MFA many times now, but it doesn't get old.</p>
                           <p><strong>Cinema/TV: </strong>I have watched many films in the US, movies have always intrigued me since I was a kid.</p>
                           <p><strong>Sports: </strong>My favorite is basketball, I humbly add that I might be quite good at it.
                              I always enjoy playing against new people and teamwork is very crucial.</p>
                           <p><strong>Technology: </strong>Technology can be very powerful and it is amazing to me how far we have come since the Stone Age.</p>
                           <p><strong>Culture: </strong>I am always embracing opportunities given to me to learn about new cultures.
                              I think it helps me keep and open mind and connect with people around the world.</p>
                           <p><strong>Literature: </strong>I read things that interests me like news and interesting facts to keep my brain
                              in an active learning state.</p>
                           <p><strong>People: </strong>I really enjoy talking to new people and getting to know them better.
                              Everyone has different stories to tell and it always interests me to see what 
                              other people went through in life and how they think about the world.</p>
                           <p><strong>Language: </strong>Similar to culture. I am learning Italian right now and it's a really fun experience.
                              I want to learn other languages as I get older, and I plan to learn Brazilian Portuguese next.</p>
                           <p><strong>Music: </strong>I like to dance and listen to music because it is fun and helps relieve stress, which isn't good to have.</p>

                              <p>The Allston branch is one of my favorites compared to other branches in Boston.
                                 The Soy Garlic Chicken Strips are the best and they also serve really good Korean and 
                                 Japanese dishes such as different kinds of sushi. There is a small bar to sit down at 
                                 so they do serve alcohol there.</p>

                                 One of my favorite appetizers is the Tuscan Wings. The rolls and oil that they serve

                                 because the pot that you cook the food in is always hot and especially good if the soup base is spicy.</p>

                              <p>Sunset Grill and Tap is good for getting food and some drinks to go with it. There Cajun curly fries are
                                 delicious and the portions they serve are big. They have a long list of drinks you can order as well.</p>

                              <p>Tavern In The Square is everywhere in Boston and the one in Allston is also quite nice.
                                 This is more of a bar and so only 21 or older can get in.
                                 They have a lot of different drinks and there are even small TVs on the walls next to the booths.
                                 This is a fun place to go with friends to watch a football or basketball game.</p>
